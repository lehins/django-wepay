Welcome to django-wepay's documentation!
========================================

Introduction
------------

Welcome to django-wepay application documentation. If you landed here it means
that you are interested in using `WePay <https://www.wepay.com>`_ in your
`Django <https://djangoproject.com>`_ project, for the same reason this app was
created. This project is under constant development and despite the fact that it
is in Beta mode it is being used in production with a great deal of success for
over a year. Despite the fact that I am only using a small portion of WePay API
my goal is to have this SDK to cover all of the API's functionality, hence any
help will be greatly appreciated, expecially in the form of pull requests and
issue submissions. In general if you are still considering WePay over some other
services I, with almost two years of expirience with WePay, will highly
recommend it.

About
-----

The goal of this app is to make usage of WePay with Django as easy and DRY as
possible. Although official `Python-SDK <https://github.com/wepay/Python-SDK>`_
proved to be a really good starting point it turned out to be very limited,
hence this app was build on top of `python-wepay
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-wepay>`_, which is maintained together, so
any ncesessary changes will be pushed upstream.
